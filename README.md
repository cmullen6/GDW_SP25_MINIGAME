Dev Log: 
-Creating the spawner system was an interesting challenge as I spent a lot of time within the Unity manual and forums. Allowing enemies to spawn in different specific locations rather than a broad range. In this instance can spawn from two different spawners on the left and right from an array of 3 enemies of varrying health. 
-Made the projectile interact with enemies instansiating from the player. Disapearing after a short distance from the player.
-Player locked inside bounds and can move left and right.
